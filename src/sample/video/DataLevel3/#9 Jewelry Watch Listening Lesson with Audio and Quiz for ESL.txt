What a beautiful watch. It goes very well with your ring.
Thank you.
Is that your wedding ring?
I'm not married yet. It's my engagement ring.
Well, congratulations. When is the big date?
In June.
Did you have the watch before getting the ring?
Actually, we bought the ring together after I got the watch.
You did a fabulous job with the selection. It's gorgeous.
Thank you so much.
