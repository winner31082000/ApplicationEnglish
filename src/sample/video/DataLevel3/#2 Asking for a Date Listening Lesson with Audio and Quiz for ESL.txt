You see that chick over there?
The one in the red shirt?
Yeah. Isn't she hot?
She's alright.
Just alright?!? She's hot!
Why don't you go talk to her?
You think she's out of my league?
Hell no! You're just a chicken that's all.
Come on. I get nervous when I talk to girls.
Why don't you go stand next to her for awhile and if an opportunity comes up, strike a conversation.
