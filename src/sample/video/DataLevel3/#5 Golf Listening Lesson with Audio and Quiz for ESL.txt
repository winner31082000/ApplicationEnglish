Hey Steve. When's the next time you're going to play golf?
I'm going out this Saturday.
Do you already have a foursome?
Unfortunately, we do. Let's plan for something together for Wednesday. We can go right after work.
That sounds good. Where do you want to play?
We won't have much time, so let's play somewhere close to work.
How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.
How much does it cost over there?
Twilight rates are 21 dollars.
