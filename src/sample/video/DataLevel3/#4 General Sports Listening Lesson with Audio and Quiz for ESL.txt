What sports do you like to play?
I like baseball and basketball.
How about football?
In my country football is brand new, so I never learned the game when I was younger.
It's a very popular game in America.
Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?
For me, it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.
Are you a football player?
No, just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football.
