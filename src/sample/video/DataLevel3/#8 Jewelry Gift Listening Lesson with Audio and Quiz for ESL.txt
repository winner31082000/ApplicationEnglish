I love your bracelet. When did you get it?
I got it awhile ago, but I haven't worn it much. You really like it?
Yeah. It's beautiful. Is it white gold or silver?
It's white gold.
Where did you buy it?
My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. and he let me pick it out.
That's so sweet. What was the occasion?
That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.
You're so lucky.
