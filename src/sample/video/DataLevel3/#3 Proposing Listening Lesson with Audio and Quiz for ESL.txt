Hey Jack. What's going on?
Hey Matt. I'm going to ask Martha to marry me?
Really? When did you decide this?
I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.
That's exciting man.
So how did you propose?
You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now.
